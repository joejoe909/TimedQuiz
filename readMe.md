## This is the start of the Quiz Template Javascript program.

The Quiz template should begin with a Intro page that gives an intro to the test.

The Test Page.

The Result page.

## Javascript logic.

Thus far I can identify two objects.

-The qaObject.

-The results obj.

## Exploiting Bootstrap.

-Using bootstrap to get a nice looking test and result page.

-Alerts are being used to display the questions and answers.

-JS will have to display to these elements.

## html
index.html - will introduce the test.
qnaCard.html - will run the user through the test. 
resultpage.html - will display once the user is done with the test.
